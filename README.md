# EntraID-Tools

## Usage Examples

### Obtaining an access token and store it in a variable to be used in subsequent commands
    
```powershell
> $token = (python . get-access-token --output_token)
> python . --access_token $token ca-export --output_file policies.json
Exporting conditional access policies...
Obtaining policies from tenant...
Writing policies to file policies.json...
```

### Obtaining an access token on the fly and chain it with other commands

```powershell
> python . get-access-token ca-export --output_file policies.json
Exporting conditional access policies...
Obtaining policies from tenant...
Writing policies to file policies.json...
```

### Using EntraID-Tools to export policies and import them using Graph PowerShell

You can use EntraID-Tools to export policies in a compatible format with Graph PowerShell. This is useful if you want to export policies from one tenant and import them into another tenant. 

This example chains the ca-export and ca-cleanup-for-import commands to export the policies and clean them up for import. The output is stored in the policies.json file. Then we read the policies from the file and import them using the New-MgIdentityConditionalAccessPolicy command. 

```powershell
> python . --access_token $token ca-export --output_file policies.json ca-cleanup-for-import
Exporting conditional access policies...
Obtaining policies from tenant...
Writing policies to file policies.json...
Cleaning up conditional access policies for import...
Reading policies from file policies.json...
Cleaning up policies...
Writing policies to file policies.json...
>  $policy = Get-Content -Path .\policies.json | ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable
>  $policy.count
2
>  New-MgIdentityConditionalAccessPolicy -BodyParameter $policy[0]

```

Note: In the above example, a token was previously obtained using the get-access-token and stored in the $token variable.
